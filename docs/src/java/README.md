## JVM

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the runtime environment for the Java programming language. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode. The JVM is a virtual machine that is implemented in Java itself. It permits the execution of Java programs on a wide range of platforms without the need for a separate native compiler or virtual machine.
